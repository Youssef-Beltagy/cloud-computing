# Program 4 notes

Should I go with azure or aws?

I want to practice ASP.NET but I also want to try using lambdas.

I will go with Lambdas because I will practice ASP.NET later anyway. But I may not get another nice chance to use lambdas like this one.

DynamoDB scan doesn't scan all the database. It only returns the first MB. That means I have to keep calling it until I reach the end of the database.


## Notes

Deal with empty lines.

Normalize names to lower case.

Must be self documentation.

Don't worry about prettifying the user interface.

Overwrite my entries.

Masonite, flask, django.

Assume good input.
